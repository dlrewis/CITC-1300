            <p>Hi, I'm Daniel Lewis. I'm an artist who's currently studying to be a 3D concept artist, as I really want to work making concept art for video games and animated movies. I love science fiction and horror, and would love to work on something in those generes. I also really like video games, especially retro FPS games like Quake or Half Life.</p>
            <p>I also draw as a hobby</p>
